## About Me
I am a Computer Science & Engineering student at the University of Iowa since 2025. I have been passionate about computers (particularly building, repair, and tech upcycling) since I was a kid. I began self-teaching C++ while I was in the Army during 2021. I went from there to studying Cyber Science & Operations at West Point for two years, before deciding to prioritize my career in 2024. In my spare time, I enjoy being around animals, playing strategy games, home networking, and learning how to fix just about anything—from my car to the kitchen sink.
